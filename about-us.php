											<h2>IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO MATTER</h2>
										</div>
										<p>
											In India people in road transportation industry faces lot of hard-ships in their day-to-day lives. There are intensive laborious/manual tasks involved with goods movement. There is a chain of people involved in this business, from the booking agents to truck drivers to their assistants, who regularly encounter challenges in executing their jobs. They don't get to see their families for many days and work in odd hours to make a living. The transport industry has been often associated with words such as corrupt and in-efficient and we at TruckHall aim to unclutter this space and bring respect and dignity in the lives of people by bridging various gaps. We want to build a company which is transparent and makes this industry reliable, efficient and tech driven.
